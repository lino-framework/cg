====================
Application carriers
====================

Each :term:`Lino application` is a :term:`software product` on its own.

When a given :term:`Lino application` is being used on only one site, the
:term:`operator <site operator>` of that site is also the :term:`application
carrier`.  Otherwise the application carrier is a separate juridical person
by which several site operators  collaborate and maintain the application as
their shared project.
