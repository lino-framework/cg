Application carriers
====================

Each :term:`Lino application` is a :term:`software product` on its own.

:term:`operator <site operator>` of that site is also the :term:`application
carrier`.  Otherwise the application carrier is a separate legal person by which
several site operators collaborate and maintain the application as their shared
project.
