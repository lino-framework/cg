==================
Business model
==================

A business model how you plan to make money [#bm1]_. Here is the suggested
business model for the :ref:`lsf`.

Income
======

- Membership fees from :term:`site operators <site operator>`.

- Sales of :term:`technical support` given by the
  :term:`core team` to :term:`development providers <development provider>`.

- Public funds for projects of public interest.

Expenses
========

The :ref:`lsf` uses their income for the following activities.

- Employ administrative personnel for management tasks.

- Operate one or several :term:`Lino sites <Lino site>` as an infrastructure for
  their work.

- Employ one or several :term:`core developers <core developer>` and build a
  :term:`core team` responsible for development and maintenance of the
  framework.

- Optionally delegate this to a third-party :term:`development providers
  <development provider>`.

- Refund costs for training, meeting or travelling to their members or
  employees.



The membership fee
==================

Every :term:`site operator` who runs a :term:`production` site should pay a
membership fee in order to contribute to the operating costs of the :ref:`lsf`.

It is not a license fee and cannot be enforced except by the fact that service
providers can require community membership as a condition in agreements with
their customers.

The yearly membership fee for :term:`site operators <site operator>` is
currently fixed to **3â‚¬** per employed :term:`end user` per month.  This amount
is decided by a board of volunteers who represent the community as a whole.  The
board should have a representative number of :term:`site operators <site
operator>` and :term:`development providers <development provider>`.

This fee is usually collected by the :term:`development provider` or the
:term:`hosting provider` who forwards it to the :ref:`lsf`.
