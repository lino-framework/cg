==================
Business model
==================

A business model how an :term:`actor` plans to make money [#bm1]_. Here is the
suggested business model for the :ref:`lsf` (which is different from that of
:doc:`rumma`).

Income
======

Every :term:`site operator` who runs a :term:`production` site pays a
yearly fee in order to contribute to the operating costs of the :ref:`lsf`.

Every :term:`development provider` pays for :term:`technical support` from the
:term:`core team` either with a yearly fee or per issue, or per hour.


Expenses
========

The :ref:`lsf` may use their income to

- employ administrative personnel for the management tasks

- operate one or several :term:`Lino sites <Lino site>` as an infrastructure for
  their work

- employ one or several :term:`developers <developer>` and build a team
  responsible for development and maintenance of the framework

- delegate development and maintenance of the framework to one or several
  :term:`development providers <development provider>`

- refund costs for training or meeting or travelling to their members or
  employees



The yearly fee
==============

The amount of this yearly fee is **3â‚¬** per employed :term:`end user` per
month. This amount is decided by a board of volunteers who represent the
community as a whole. The board should have a representative number of
:term:`site operators <site operator>` and :term:`development providers
<development provider>`.

The fee can be perceived by a :term:`development provider` from their customers
who forwards it to the :ref:`lsf`.
