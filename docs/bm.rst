The yearly fee
==============

The amount of this fee is **3â‚¬** per employed :term:`end user` per month. This
amount is decided by a board of members with at least two :term:`site operators
<site operator>` and one :term:`development provider`.

The fee can be perceived by a :term:`development provider` from their customers
who forwards it to the :ref:`lsf`.
