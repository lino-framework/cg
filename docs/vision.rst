Vision statement
================

The basic ideas behind the :ref:`lsf` are developed below in a few steps:

Many developers feel that free software is fundamentally better than
proprietary software [#fsf1]_.  While this seems obvious for developers, it is
less clear for stakeholders and investors.  Most business models in software
industry still rely on some proprietary part for generating revenue. On the
other hand there is a growing list of organizations devoted to free software
[#wikipedia1]_.

We believe that the future belongs to free software.  A free human
civilization is incompatible with proprietary software.

While the free world has an operating system, an office suite, several good
frameworks for developing web and desktop applications, there is no sustainable
solution for organizations who want their own :term:`customized database
application`. The market of customized database application frameworks is
currently dominated by a few proprietary giants.

The business model used by :doc:`rumma` for the :term:`Lino framework` has the
potential of becoming a solution for this problem.

This potential is currently merely visible to investors and stakeholders. There
is much work to do to bring our idea to the next level so that it can grow from
a small private corporation into a reliable international organization.

:doc:`rumma` wants to remain a family-sized dynamic team of creative
developers.  Hoping that :doc:`rumma` would become big isn't a solution.  The
role of bringing Lino to the next level must be played by an organization that
does not have any private interest. A private corporation with limited
responsibility is not a valid candidate for this job.

That's why Lino needs a foundation or some similar legal person, inspired by
the `PSF <https://www.python.org/psf/>`__ or the `DSF
<https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/>`__.

The objective of the :doc:`lsf` is to act as the operator of the :term:`Lino
framework` in a sustainable way based on above ideas.

.. glossary::

    Lino community

        The group of :term:`actors <actor>` who use the :term:`Lino framework`
        as a :term:`software product` and adhere to our community guide.

        The :term:`Lino framework` is free software and you may use it without
        adhering to our community guide. In that case you simply aren't a
        member of our community.

        The legal entity representing the :term:`Lino community` is
        :doc:`rumma` as long as there is no :doc:`lsf`.

    Actor

        A physical or legal person who assumes one or several roles within our
        community.
