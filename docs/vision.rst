Sustainably Free Software
=========================

We believe that proprietary software is not a sustainable option for a free
human civilization.  We believe that the future belongs to sustainably free
software. This belief is not naive.  There is a growing list of organizations
devoted to free software [#wikipedia1]_. Many developers feel that free software
is fundamentally better than proprietary software [#fsf1]_.


A legally free :term:`software product` cannot be sustainable when one of its
components is non-free. Documentation is an important part of a product. An
otherwise free product is not sustainable when documentation and expert
knowledge about it is controlled by a single actor.

What seems obvious to many developers is obviously less clear to investors.
Many business models in software industry still rely on some proprietary part
for generating revenue. Some carriers of free software products gain control
over the usage rights on some part of the product like an installer or a front
end.  Such attempts are quickly disclosed and lead to a free (but weakened) fork
in the best case, or to the death of the product in the worst case.


Objective : Why we exist
========================

The sustainably free world has already an operating system, an office suite,
several good frameworks for developing web and desktop applications, and many
other projects that are steadily gaining users.

But until now there is no sustainably free solution for developing
:term:`customized database application`. This market segment is still dominated
by a few proprietary giants.

We believe that the :term:`Lino framework` has the potential of becoming a
solution for this problem.

At the moment this potential is merely visible to investors and stakeholders.
There is much work to do to bring Lino to the next level.

Who should do that work? The motor behind Lino is currently :doc:`rumma`, a
small private corporation who wants to remain family-sized. But Lino actually
needs a reliable international organization as carrier.

Even if somebody would convince :doc:`rumma` to become big and bring Lino to the
next level, this wouldn't be a solution. Sooner or later they would turn Lino
into something which is no longer really free. A private corporation with
limited responsibility is not a valid candidate for the job of bringing Lino to
the next level. This role must be played by an organization that does not have
any private interest.

That's why Lino needs a foundation like the `PSF
<https://www.python.org/psf/>`__ the `DSF
<https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/>`__ or the `WMF
<https://wikimediafoundation.org/>`__, or a similar legal person.

The objective of the :doc:`lsf` is to act as the promoter and carrier of the
:term:`Lino framework` in a sustainable way and based on above ideas.

Advantage : How Lino is different
=================================

Primary **target users** of Lino applications are organizations who need a
customized application and do not have their own in-house developer. Such
organisations are traditionally doomed to agree to some level of vendor
lock-in. Lino applications avoid vendor lock-in because both the source code
and documentation are published under a :term:`permissive Free Software
license`.

The advantage of Lino versus other frameworks is a **reduced total cost of
ownership**. Most parts of a *development project* become easier and cheaper for
the :term:`site operator`. This includes analysis, writing a prototype, adapting your
application to changed needs and long-term maintenance. Lino applications are
"more reliable and maintainable than MS-Access for cheaper than SAP".
