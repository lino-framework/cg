"certified" Lino hoster.  The condition for getting listed is your interest in
Lino, your permission, your ability to give professional advice about whether a
Lino solution can make sense in a given context, and a potential ability to
become a qualified hosting provider when needed.

   recommented Lino hosting providers.
