Development providers

or other :term:`software engineers <software engineer>` and operates an
infrastructure for their collaboration.

This section describes the work of a :term:`development provider`.


Development services
====================

.. glossary::

    analysis

        The work of analysing the needs of a :term:`project operator` in order
        to implement a software solution which helps them to reach their goals.
        The analyst must then describe the customers needs in a language to be
        understood by a programmer.

    programming

        Apply changes to a :term:`source file`. Publish the changes.

    testing

        Quality Control. Make sure that a new version does not introduce
        regressions or other side effects.

    deployment

        Installing the software on a remote site, either public or for a
        :term:`site operator`.

    developer support

        Support given to an :term:`application developer`.

    expert support

        Support given by an :term:`application carrier` to a :term:`site
        expert`. This is more technical and specialized than :term:`end-user
        support`.

    manual testing

      A method of software testing where the testers manually execute test cases
      without using any automation tools in order to find bugs in the software
      system.  It is imperative for every release because full automated testing
      is not possible. Manual testing is usually done by experienced end users
      because it requires a good knowledge of the functional requirements.
      Optionally they can be executed by the :term:`application developer`
      before a release, or by the :term:`site maintainer` after an upgrade.
