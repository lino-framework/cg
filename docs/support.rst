Support sales models
====================

There are two fundamentally different sales models for services :
:term:`flat-rate support` and :term:`per-hour support`.

.. glossary::

  Flat-rate support

    A support sales mode where the customer pays a given sum for a given period
    and gets unlimited support.  The only limit are human resources. The
    provider promises that they give their best to help the customer with any
    problem. Upon agreement the provider can write additional invoices for extra
    work which deserves more money than usual.  This model works well when
    provider and customer trust each other and want a long-term relationship.
    The project is seen as a cooperation where both partners contribute their
    work. Advantage is reduced administrative cost and increased communication.

  Per-hour support

    A support sales mode where the customer pays for every hour of work required
    by the provider.  The provider is responsible for writing service reports
    and methods for protecting against cost overflow.
