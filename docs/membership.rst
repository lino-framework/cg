Membership fees
===============

The :ref:`lsf` is financed by its members who agree to pay a **membership fee**.
Membership fees are an important item of our :doc:`business model <bm>`.

Every :term:`site operator` who runs a :term:`production` site should pay a
membership fee. The suggested monthly membership fee for :term:`site operators
<site operator>` is currently fixed to

  **1 €** per model + **2€** per user

Both numbers are shown in the :menuselection:`Site --> About` dialog box.

Note that the membership fee is **not a license fee**.  Lino is and will always
remain free software.  You can develop and run a Lino application on your own
without being member of the community. Our only way to "force" you to pay a
membership fee is that our service providers require you to pay it before
agreeing to give you support. This fee is usually collected by the
:term:`development provider` or the :term:`hosting provider` who forwards it to
the :ref:`lsf`.

Of course we actually don't need to force you. You know that a framework
requires maintenance, and that you want Lino to be maintained.  Your main
concern is whether the costs are being distributed correctly. That's why we have
the *membership board*.

The membership board
====================

The **membership board** decides about changes in the formula for computing
membership fees and the rules for getting reductions or exemptions. The board
consists of volunteers who represent the community as a whole.  It has a
representative number of :term:`site operators <site operator>` and
:term:`development providers <development provider>`.

You may apply for reduced membership fees if your user count may be limited to
the number of :term:`end user` who are actually employed by you.
