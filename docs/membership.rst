==========
Membership
==========

The :term:`Lino community` is made of its members.

.. glossary::

  Lino community

    The group of natural or juridical persons who use the :term:`Lino framework`
    and adhere to the rules described in this guide when collaborating with
    other members.
    Legally represented by :doc:`rumma` as long as there is no :doc:`lsf`.

  Community member

    A juridical or natural person who declares adhering to the :term:`Lino
    community` and the rules described in the community guide.

See also :doc:`/actors`.

Becoming a member
=================

As a :term:`site operator` you become a :term:`community member`
by entering into contract with a :term:`service provider` who binds you to the
rules described in the community guide.

As a :term:`service provider` you become a member when the :term:`community
board` accepts your candidature.

The list of community members is not published.

The membership fee
==================

.. glossary::

    Membership fee

      A fee to be paid by certain community members as a contribution to
      operation costs of the :doc:`lsf`.


Every :term:`site operator` who runs a :term:`production site` pays a
:term:`membership fee`.  Other members do not need to pay any membership fee.

The suggested monthly **base fee** for :term:`site operators <site operator>` is
currently fixed to **0.5 €** per database model + **3€** per user.

These base amounts are based on **August 2008** and are adapted according to the
Belgian Consumer Price Index. For example, in July 2018 each amount was to be
multiplied by 1.349855356585091.

The numbers of database models and users are shown in the :menuselection:`Site
--> About` dialog box.

Your user count may be reduced to the number of :term:`end users <end user>` who
are actually employed by you.

The membership fee is **doubled during your first year** of membership.

The :term:`membership fee` is collected by the :term:`development provider` or
the :term:`hosting provider` who forwards it to the :ref:`lsf`.

When you are asked to renew your membership fee, you may decide to leave the
community and still continue using Lino without the support of the community.

The :term:`membership fee` is not a license fee
===============================================

:term:`Membership fees <membership fee>` are similar to **license fees** in that
they are an important item of our :doc:`business model <bm>`. We know that a
reliable framework requires maintenance.  But there are two important strategic
differences:

- Lino is and will always remain free software.
  You may use any part of it without being a :term:`community member`.
  You may leave the community at any moment and still continue using Lino as free
  software. The only way of forcing you to pay your membership fee is that a
  recognized :term:`service provider` will require you to do so as part of their
  contract with you.

- The :term:`community board` makes sure that the costs are being distributed
  correctly.


The community board
===================

.. glossary::

    Community board

      A group of natural persons who decide about changes in the community
      guide.  See `The community board`_.



The :term:`community board` decides about changes in the community guide,
including the rules for computing and applying membership fees.

The board consists of volunteers who represent the community as a whole.  There
is at least one :term:`site operator` and one :term:`service provider`.

Each member of the board represents one or several :term:`community members
<community member>`.
