Membership
==========

The :term:`Lino community` is made of its members.

.. glossary::

  Lino community

    The group of natural or juridical persons who use the :term:`Lino framework`
    and adhere to the rules described in this guide when collaborating with
    other members.
    Legally represented by :doc:`rumma` as long as there is no :doc:`lsf`.

  community member

    A legal or natural person who declares adhering to the :term:`Lino
    community` and the rules described in the community guide.

See also :doc:`/actors`.

Becoming a member
=================

As a :term:`site operator` you become a :term:`community member`
by entering into contract with a :term:`service provider` who binds you to the
rules described in the community guide.

As a :term:`service provider` you become a member when the :term:`Community
Board` accepts your candidature.

The list of community members is not published.

The membership fee
==================

.. glossary::

    membership fee

      A fee to be paid by certain community members as a contribution to
      operation costs of the :doc:`lsf`.


Every :term:`site operator` who runs a :term:`production site` pays a
:term:`membership fee`.

Detailed conditions are yet to be decided.

One idea is to have a monthly **base fee** for :term:`site operators <site
operator>` based on the number of database models and users. The numbers of
database models and users are shown in the :menuselection:`Site --> About`
dialog box. Your user count may be reduced to the number of :term:`end users
<end user>` who are actually employed by you.

Such a :term:`membership fee` would be collected by the :term:`development
provider` or the :term:`hosting provider` who forwards it to the :ref:`lsf`.

When you are asked to renew your membership fee, you may decide to leave the
community and still continue using Lino without the support of the community.

The :term:`membership fee` is not a license fee
===============================================

A :term:`membership fee` is similar to a **license fee** in that their sum an
important item of our :doc:`business model <bm>`. A reliable framework requires
maintenance.  But there are two important strategic differences:

- Lino is and will always remain Free Software.
  You may use any part of it without being a :term:`community member`.
  You may leave the community at any moment and still continue using Lino as free
  software. You may even make money using Lino without being a community member.
  The only way of forcing you to pay your membership fee is that a
  recognized :term:`service provider` will require you to do so as part of their
  contract with you.

- The :term:`Community Board` makes sure that the costs are being distributed
  correctly.


The community board
===================

.. glossary::

    Community Board

      A group of natural persons who decide about changes in the :term:`Community
      Guide`.  See `The community board`_.


The :term:`Community Board` decides about changes in the :term:`Community
Guide`, including the rules for computing and applying membership fees.

The board consists of volunteers who represent the community as a whole.  There
is at least one :term:`site operator` and one :term:`service provider`.

Each member of the board represents one or several :term:`community members
<community member>`.
