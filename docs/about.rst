About this website
===================


This website defines and describes general concepts regarding the collaboration
between different business partners on one or several projects that use Lino
software.

This website is published and maintained by Rumma & Ko Ltd. who can change it
at any moment.

For agreements which refer to this website, the version that was published at
the moment of the agreement is binding unless the partners agree on a more
recent version.


The **Lino community** is the group of people and organizations who use the
Lino framework.

It is currently led by Luc Saffre who acts as a kind of de facto BDFL. Luc is
paid by :doc:`rumma` who get most of their income from Lino.

All work on Lino is published as free software under a BSD license. The
copyright holder for Lino, the legal entity and official address of the Lino
community is :doc:`rumma` as long as there is no :doc:`lsf`.
