The work of powering the Lino community is currently being done by
`Rumma & Ko <http://www.saffre-rumma.net>`_.

Here is their statement about this:

   We are doing our best to help the Lino community becoming a big one, but we
   have no plans of becoming *ourselves* big.  If the Lino community would get
   bigger than we can manage, we recommend that it should be governed by an
   independent organization which does not have any private motivation on its own.
   We work on creating this organization: :ref:`lsf`.
