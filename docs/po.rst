Operators (no longer used)
==========================

A :term:`Lino site` needs somebody who acts as its :term:`site operator`.

.. glossary::

    project operator

        A legal or natural person who brings a Lino project into life.

        Delegates responsibilities to other actors:
        a :term:`system administrator`,
        a :term:`server provider`,
        a :term:`server administrator`

        In a small Lino project with a single site on a single server, the
        project operator can be :term:`server operator`, :term:`site operator`
        and :term:`application carrier` in one person.  In bigger projects
        these roles can be distributed among independent legal persons.
