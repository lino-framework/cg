    Lino software project

        A project where some :term:`actor` decides to use the :term:`Lino
        framework` for their purposes.

        For example you develop your own :term:`Lino application` and run it
        on a :term:`site <Lino site>` of your own.

        Or you may operate your own :term:`Lino server` and share maintenance
        and development costs for one or several Lino applications with other
        :term:`site operators <site operator>`.

    Project operator

        Brings a :term:`Lino software project` into life.
        Plans the project and decides about its destiny.
        Decides which features to add or to remove.
        Does strategic decisions.

        Delegates responsibilities to other actors:
        a :term:`system administrator`,
        a :term:`server provider`,
        a :term:`server maintainer`
        and an :term:`application expert`.
        Organizes :term:`end-user support`.

        A small Lino project can be a single site on a single server. In that
        case the project operator is
        :term:`server operator`,
        :term:`site operator`
        and :term:`application operator` in one person.

    Application operator

        When a same :term:`Lino application` is being used on several sites,
        the :term:`operators <site operator>` of these sites collaborate and
        maintain the application as their shared :term:`Lino software project`.
