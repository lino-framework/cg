    Developer

        Writes, publishes, maintains and optimizes *source files*.

        A *Lino developer* does this for the source files that make
        up a :term:`Lino application` or the :term:`Lino framework`.

    Source file

        A file which serves as a base for building an executable program or
        consumable content (e.g. text, image, sound or video).

        Some source file formats commonly used in a Lino project are :file:`.py`,
        :file:`.js` and :file:`.rst`.

        Some consumable content file formats commonly used in a Lino project
        are :file:`.html` and :file:`.pdf`.
