    Analysis

        The work of analysing the needs of a :term:`project operator` in order
        to implement a software solution which helps them to work more
        efficiently.

    Programming

        Apply changes to a :term:`source file`. Publish the changes.

    Testing

        Quality Control. Make sure that a new version does not introduce
        regressions or other side effects.

    Deployment

        Installing the software on a remote site, either public or for a
        :term:`site operator`.

    Developer support

        Support given by the :term:`core developer` to an :term:`application
        programmer`.

    Expert support

        Support given by an :term:`application programmer` to a :term:`site
        expert` about his work. This is more technical and specialized than
        :term:`end-user support`.

    Maintenance

        Minor changes in the software which are required by technological
        evolutions.
