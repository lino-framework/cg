    Server provider

        Installs and maintain a server where a :term:`Lino
        application` will be running.  They care about reliability and make sure that
        your Lino is always available to respond when you need it. They care about
        security and protect your system against hackers. They make backups of your
        data to make sure it doesn't get lost in case of a serious accident.  They care
        about scaling. As your site will grow in terms of number of users and the
        amount of data stored, you might want to move to a bigger machine.
