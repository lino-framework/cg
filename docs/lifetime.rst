Lifetime of a Lino project
==========================

This document describes the lifetime of a Lino project.

Interview
=========

An **interview** is when a future *site operator* meets with a *consultant* in
order to check whether their problem is something for Lino.

One aspect is the technical side: whether a Lino style application makes sense.
Lino as a framework has features and limitations.

Another aspect is the financial side: what budget is available for (1)
development and (2) for maintenance of the production site.

We may decide to work for free during
some time, but Lino is our business. A sustainable solution needs maintenance
and support.  Free software is free as in "free speech", not as in "free beer".
There are different models for selling our work on Lino. During the first 15
years we worked successfully by offering fixed yearly flat-rate contracts: the
customer pays a given sum per year and for this they get unlimited support and
upgrades.  The only limit are our human resources. We promise to our flat-rate
customers that we give our best (but not more) to help them with any problem.
We can write additional invoices for extra work if the customer agrees that
some project deserves more money than usual. Since 2016 we also offer per-hour
service where the customer pays for every minute of our time (including
support, analysis, code changes, write documentation).

There are other things that should be clear after the interview:

- Who will act as the single contact person responsible for analyzing the
  needs of the site operator and training the end-users.  Depending on the site operator size this can
  quickly become a full-time job on its own.

Another aspect is the legal side:

Does the site operator want a proprietary application for which they hold the
copyright?  Or do they agree to share the development work by publishing source
code and documentation as Free Software using a BSD license?

Offer and prototype
===================

Now the *consultant* must find a developer who agrees to
write an offer and a prototype
for the project. They don't need to pay for this.  The prototype is part of our
marketing work.  It is easier and more efficient to write a prototype than to
write a full analysis.

Preview sites

.. glossary::

    Preview site

        A *preview site* is a copy of a production site as it would look using the
        newest version of Lino.  It is made available to end users so they can preview
        and test their coming version before an upgrade.

The primary goal of a preview site is to help the site operator to test new
features and to reduce stress caused by unexpected results after an upgrade.
