Individuals
=================

Here is a list of individual humans who deserve being mentioned here because
they have contributed to Lino.  We put them into several categories: `Active
contributors`_  have some official job within the community, `Deserved
contributors`_ contributed unofficially and agreed to be listed with their
contact data, and `Background contributors`_ just did not yet care of giving us
their permission to be mentioned here (or we didn't yet ask for it).  We don't
consider first names as something private. Before giving your permission to
publish your full name here, please consider that this step cannot be undone.
If --for whatever regrettable reason-- you would decide to no longer be on this
list, we would of course remove you from the currently visble version, but you
would still remain visible in the Git history of this document (for example
`here
<https://github.com/lino-framework/cg/blob/master/docs/humans.rst>`__)
until the end of time since this content is published under the BSD license.
