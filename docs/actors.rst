======================
Actors and their roles
======================

An **actor** is a physical or legal person who assumes one or several roles
within our community.


.. glossary::

    site operator

        Operates (runs) a :term:`Lino site`.  They are the owner of the data
        stored on that site.  They are responsible for granting or revoking
        access permissions to individual :term:`end users <end user>` and for
        protecting that data against leaking or other privacy issues.

    site manager

        Manages a :term:`Lino site` via its web interface. Creates accounts for
        :term:`end users <end user>` and can change site-wide configuration
        settings. Has full access to all functions provided via the web
        interface.

        Coordinates the requirements of the :term:`site operator`
        and the :term:`end users <end user>`
        with the technical activities (:term:`developer` and :term:`deployer`).
        Collects and centralizes user requests

    end user

        A human who uses a given *Lino site* for their daily work.

    support provider

        Gives support to :term:`end users <end user>`.

        Organizes trainings for :term:`end users <end user>` and :term:`key users <key user>`.

    key user

        An experienced :term:`end user` who knows every detail about how to use
        a given part of the application, and who can explain and give
        first-aid support to their colleagues.

    server provider

        Installs and maintain a server where a :term:`Lino
        application will be running.  They care about reliability and make sure that
        your Lino is always available to respond when you need it. They care about
        security and protect your system against hackers. They make backups of your
        data to make sure it doesn't get lost in case of a serious accident.  They care
        about scaling. As your site will grow in terms of number of users and the
        amount of data stored, you might want to move to a bigger machine.

    developer

        A **developer** writes, maintains, optimizes and publishes the source
        code and documentation of a particular project.  An **application
        developer** does this for a given :term:`Lino application`. A **core
        developer** does the same for general features of the Lino framework.

    consultant

        A **consultant** is somebody who knows the possibilities and
        limitations of the Lino framework and give you neutral advice about
        whether or not to choose Lino as a solution. They help you with
        analyzing and formulating your needs and finding the right business
        partners who will implement a solution.

    system administrator

        Manages the IT system of a :ref:`site operator`. Installs virgin Linux
        servers, makes them available in a public or local network, protects
        them against attacks from the outside.

    deployer

        Installs and maintains the software on a :term:`Lino server`.

    site coordinator






Miscellaneous
=============

A **support provider** is somebody who helps end users if they have a question.
The support provider is always available when end users need them. If they
cannot help directly, then they know how to ask other actors.


A **client device** is a device used by an *end user* to access a *Lino site*.

A **hoster** is somebody who sets up a server with a Lino site and who helps
users to connect to that server.
A **hosting provider** does the same, but as a third-party company and not as
employee of the site owner.

An **analyst** is somebody who collaborates with users in order to
analyze their needs, and who then explains to the *application
developer* how to make the application better (or how to make it at
all, in case of new development projects).

A **trainer** is somebody who can explain a given Lino application to
its users. Trainers also write documentation for users.
