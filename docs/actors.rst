======================
Actors and their roles
======================

A **consultant** is somebody who knows the possibilities and limitations of the
Lino framework and give you neutral advice about whether or not to choose Lino
as a solution. They help you with analyzing and formulating your needs and
finding the right business partners who will implement a solution.

A **site operator** operates (runs) a given *Lino site*.  They are the owner of
the data stored on that site.  They are responsible for granting or revoking
access permissions to individual *end users* and for protecting that data
against leaking or other privacy issues.

An **application owner** decides about the destiny of a given *Lino application*.
They bring the idea into life,
they decide how to promote the application,
they decide which features to add or to remove.
They do strategic decisions like delegating responsibilities to actors.

Application ownership is not a legally defined term unless you use it in a
legal document, e.g. a maintenance contract.  Such documents should clearly
state who is the application owner and who is the copyright holder.
See also :doc:`copyright`.

A **site administrator** manages a site via its web interface. They create
accounts for end users and can change configuration settings.

An **application developer** writes, maintains, optimizes and publishes the
source code and documentation of a particular *Lino application*. A **core
developer** does the same for general features of the Lino framework.

A **system manager** is an actor who manages the IT system of his/her
employer or customer, who installs virgin Linux servers, cares about their
availability in a public or local network, who protects them against attacks
from the outside.

A **server provider** installs and maintain a server where your Lino
application will be running.  They care about reliability and make sure that
your Lino is always available to respond when you need it. They care about
security and protect your system against hackers. They make backups of your
data to make sure it doesn't get lost in case of a serious accident.  They care
about scaling. As your site will grow in terms of number of users and the
amount of data stored, you might want to move to a bigger machine.



Miscellaneous
=============

An **actor** is a physical or legal person who assumes one or several roles
within our community.


An **end user** is a human who uses a given *Lino site* for their daily work.
As a Lino end user you should know how to contact your *support provider*.

A **support provider** is somebody who helps end users if they have a question.
The support provider is always available when end users need them. If they
cannot help directly, then they know how to ask other actors.


A **client device** is a device used by an *end user* to access a *Lino site*.

A **hoster** is somebody who sets up a server with a Lino site and who helps
users to connect to that server.
A **hosting provider** does the same, but as a third-party company and not as
employee of the site owner.

An **analyst** is somebody who collaborates with users in order to
analyze their needs, and who then explains to the *application
developer* how to make the application better (or how to make it at
all, in case of new development projects).

A **trainer** is somebody who can explain a given Lino application to
its users. Trainers also write documentation for users.
