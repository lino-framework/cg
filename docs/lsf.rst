Lino Software Foundation
========================

The **Lino Software Foundation** does not yet exist legally, it is getting born
in our brains.  It would be something like the PSF or the DSF.

Lino fundamentally differs from proprietary frameworks or open source projects
controlled by a corporation that makes money from selling license fees for
proprietary documentation.

We believe that a software system and its community cannot be sustainable when
they are powered by a single company who "owns" the copyright on source code or
documentation.
