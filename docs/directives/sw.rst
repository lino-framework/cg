  software product

    An intellectual work consisting of a set of
    :term:`source files <source file>` that may, after having been compiled, run
    on a computer to make it provide a given set of functionalities.

    .. program code and documentation, stored in :term:`source files
       <source file>` in one or several :term:`repositories <source
       repository>`.

  copyright holder

    The legal or natural person who wrote the :term:`source files <source file>`
    of a :term:`software product` and published them.  Modified or unmodified
    copies of the :term:`source files <source file>` may be used only with
    permission of the :term:`copyright holder` who usually specifies a *license*
    that regulates how his work may be used.

  proprietary license

    A license where the :term:`copyright holder` reserves all usage rights to
    themselves.

    When using a proprietary license, the copyright holder of a software product
    is automatically the :term:`product carrier`.

  free software license

    A licence where the :term:`copyright holder` explicitly gives away all usage
    rights under certain conditions.

    A :term:`software product` published under a free license
    may be used by other software developers as a base for derived
    work.  This is why the :term:`product carrier` of a free software product is
    legally not defined. Free software belongs to nobody, because it belongs to
    everybody.
