.. glossary::

  software product

    An intellectual work consisting of a set of
    :term:`source files <source file>` that may, after having been compiled, run
    on a computer to make it provide a given set of functionalities.

    .. program code and documentation, stored in :term:`source files
       <source file>` in one or several :term:`repositories <source
       repository>`.

  copyright holder

    The legal or natural person who wrote the :term:`source files <source file>`
    of a :term:`software product` and published them.  Modified or unmodified
    copies of the :term:`source files <source file>` may be used only with
    permission of the :term:`copyright holder` who usually specifies a *license*
    that regulates how his work may be used.

  proprietary license

    When using a **proprietary license**, the :term:`copyright holder` controls
    all usage rights and therefore is also automatically the :term:`product
    carrier`.

  product carrier

    The legal or natural person who *carries* and *governs* the usage of a
    :term:`software product` and represents the community of its users. He
    invests into development, maintenance and marketing of the product. He
    decides about the product's lifetime, usage conditions, functionalities and
    priorities of development. He can delegate parts of his work to external
    service providers.

  free software license

    When publishing a :term:`software product` under a **free license**, the
    :term:`copyright holder` explicitly renounces from controlling usage rights
    on the product. Such a product may be used by anybody as a base for derived
    work.  This is why the :term:`product carrier` of a free software product is
    legally not defined. Free software belongs to nobody, because it belongs to
    everybody.
