  Software product

    A **software product** is an intellectual work consisting of a set of
    :term:`source files <source file>` that may, after having been compiled, run
    on a computer to make it provide a given set of functionalities.

    .. program code and documentation, stored in :term:`source files
       <source file>` in one or several :term:`repositories <source
       repository>`.

  Copyright holder

    The **copyright holder** of a :term:`software product` is the legal or
    physical person who wrote the :term:`source files <source file>` and
    published them.  Modified or unmodified copies of the :term:`source files
    <source file>` may be used only with permission of the :term:`copyright
    holder` who usually specifies a *license* that regulates how his work may be
    used.

  Proprietary license

    When using a **proprietary license**, the :term:`copyright holder` controls
    all usage rights and therefore is also automatically the :term:`product
    carrier`.

  Product carrier

    A **product carrier** of a :term:`software product` is the juridical or
    natural person who *governs* its usage and represents the community of its
    users. He invests into development, maintenance and marketing of the
    product. He decides about the product's lifetime, usage conditions,
    functionalities and priorities of development. He can delegate parts of his
    work to external service providers.

  Free software license

    When publishing a :term:`software product` under a **free license**, the
    :term:`copyright holder` explicitly renounces from controlling usage rights
    on the product. Such a product may be used by anybody as a base for derived
    work.  This is why the :term:`product carrier` of a free software product is
    legally not defined. Free software belongs to nobody, because it belongs to
    everybody.
