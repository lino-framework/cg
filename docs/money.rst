Making money with Lino
======================

This document describes the lifetime of a Lino project and how :doc:`rumma` use
Lino to make money.  This is of course not the only possible model for using
Lino.

Interview
=========

One of our developers has an **interview** with the customer candidate in order
to check whether their problem is something for Lino.

One aspect is the technical side: whether a Lino style application makes
sense, whether I am able to write it for them.

Another aspect is the financial side: We may decide to work for free during
some time, but Lino is our business. A sustainable solution needs maintenance
and support.  Free software is free as in "free speech", not as in "free beer".
There are different models for selling our work on Lino. During the first 15
years we worked successfully by offering fixed yearly flat-rate contracts: the
customer pays a given sum per year and for this they get unlimited support and
upgrades.  The only limit are our human resources. We promise to our flat-rate
customers that we give our best (but not more) to help them with any problem.
We can write additional invoices for extra work if the customer agrees that
some project deserves more money than usual. Since 2016 we also offer per-hour
service where the customer pays for every minute of our time (including
support, analysis, code changes, write documentation).

There are other things that should be clear after the interview:

- We require our bigger customers to have a single contact person who will be
  responsible for analysing their needs and training the end-users.  Depending on
  the customer's size this can quickly become a full-time job on its own.

- We should agree on copyright. We do not currently develop any proprietary
  application. This is legally perfectly possible, but we just don't have any
  customer who refuses to share their work.

Offer and prototype
===================

If we have the feeling that they need a Lino, we write an offer and a prototype
for them. They don't need to pay for this.  The prototype is part of our
marketing work.  It is easier and more efficient to write a prototype than to
write a full analysis.
