Copyright considerations
========================


Application ownership and copyright
===================================

All parts of the Lino framework are published using the BSD license with
:doc:`rumma` as copyright holder.

The **copyright holder** of source code or documentation is the *developer* who
wrote and published it.  This is not the same as the *application owner*
because all source code and documentation is published as Free Software using
the BSD license.

The BSD license allows to write and publish extensions, applications,
documentation or otherwise derivative work under a proprietary (non-free)
license. Such work is not considered part of the *Lino framework*. The Lino
Community does neither prohibit nor support such work.

Any other actor may decide at any moment to start a fork of application or to
use your application for their own purpose without even asking your permission.

Source contributions
====================

If you contribute some code to some repository of the Lino project, we ask you
to assign your copyright to *Rumma & Ko Ltd* because we want to avoid legal
problems in case we want to change the license in the future and because we do
not want to add every individual contributor to every copyright statement.

Currently most Lino source files are marked either *(c) Rumma & Ko Ltd* or *(c)
Luc Saffre*.  Those with Luc just haven't yet been converted to Rumma & Ko Ltd.
Rumma & Ko is Luc's employer, owned by Luc and his wife, so they are in fact
the same, the difference is just the legal form.

We consider Rumma & Ko as the official copyright holder of the Lino framework
because they are currently the community motor.  This seems the most reasonable
formulation at the moment. We plan to change the copyright holder to
:doc:`lsf` in the future.  As long as there is no legal entity to
act as copyright holder, everybody must just trust that Rumma & Ko will manage
these things before Luc dies.  We are still working on the details.


Contributor License Agreement
=============================

When you contribute a change to Lino, then basically you are the
copyright holder of your work and you agree to publish your work under
the same license as Lino and you ask us to integrate your
contribution.

We did not (yet) formulate and sign any Contributor License Agreement
as e.g. `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/>`__
does it.  Every contributor is liable for their work: if one of us
would (accidentally) publish a file with sensitive confidential data
or copyrighted content, only that particular person (or their
employer) would be liable.
