Copyright considerations
========================

Lino is Free software
=====================

The members of the Lino Community agree that the result of their work is made
available as :term:`Free software` to everybody.

This is legally formulated by the fact that all parts of the :term:`Lino
framework` are published using a :term:`BSD license`.

The Lino Community is dedicated to work according to the :term:`BSD license`
and does neither prohibit nor support derivative work by non-members under
other licenses.

The :term:`copyright holder` for all source files of the Lino framework is
:doc:`rumma`.  This seems the most reasonable and practical formulation as long
as Rumma & Ko are the community motor. We plan to change the copyright holder
to :doc:`lsf` in the future. As long as there is no legal entity to act as
copyright holder, everybody must trust that Rumma & Ko will manage things
correctly.

.. glossary::

    Copyright holder

        The legal or physical person who claims authorship of a :term:`source
        file` or a set thereof.

        The copyright holder usually specifies a *license* which regulates how
        his work may be used.

    Free software

        Software that is published by its :term:`copyright holder` using a
        license which permits and encourages sharing of derivative work.

    Permissive Free software

        Free software licenses can be grouped into two families: *permissive*
        and *protective*.   Permissive free-software licenses like the :term:`BSD
        license` have minimal requirements about how the software or derivative
        work can be redistributed. Protective licenses like the GNU GPL adds
        the restriction that all such redistribution is licensed under the same
        license.

    BSD license

        The license used by the Lino Community for their work.

        See also `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses>`__


Application ownership
=====================

For :term:`Permissive Free software` like Lino it makes sense to define an
:term:`application owner` in addition to the :term:`copyright holder`.

In case of proprietary software or protective Free software, the
:term:`copyright holder` is also the :term:`application owner`. But with
permissive Free software, the :term:`copyright holder` has no legal means of
regulating how their work is being used.

Any other entity may decide at any moment to start a fork of our application or
to modify our application for their own purpose without even asking our
permission.  This is because the BSD license is more liberal than the GPL
licences in that it allows to write and publish derivative work under a
proprietary (non-free) license.

With permissive Free software

This is why the :term:`application owner` should be clearly stated in legal
documents, e.g. maintenance contracts.

As an option, the :term:`application owner` may additionally register their
application as a trademark.



.. glossary::

    Application owner

        Decides about the destiny of a given :term:`Lino application`.
        Brings the idea into life,
        decides which features to add or to remove,
        decides promotes it and use the application.
        Does strategic decisions like delegating responsibilities to actors.





Source contributions
====================

If you contribute some code to some repository of the Lino project, we ask you
to assign your copyright to *Rumma & Ko Ltd* because we want to avoid legal
problems in case we want to change the license in the future and because we do
not want to add every individual contributor to every copyright statement.


Contributor License Agreement
=============================

When you contribute a change to Lino, then basically you are the
copyright holder of your work and you agree to publish your work under
the same license as Lino and you ask us to integrate your
contribution.

We did not (yet) formulate and sign any Contributor License Agreement
as e.g. `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/>`__
does it.  Every contributor is liable for their work: if one of us
would (accidentally) publish a file with sensitive confidential data
or copyrighted content, only that particular person (or their
employer) would be liable.
