What is Lino?
=============

**Lino** is a :term:`framework`
for developing :term:`customized database
applications <customized database application>`
without getting locked into a proprietary vendor.
It is a sustainably free :term:`software product` governed and
maintained by the :ref:`lsf`.

Lino is **based on free software technologies** like `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__, `React <https://reactjs.org/>`__, `Sencha
ExtJS <https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`__, `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ and `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__.

Lino is suitable for writing **complex applications**.  For example Lino Welfare
has 155 database models in 65 plug-ins and 16 user types.

Lino is an **encompassing** framework because it provides *back-end
technologies* (server, application, database), *front-end technologies*
(JavaScript, ExtJS, React), a *documentation framework* and *marketing models*.

Lino **encourages sharing**: the :ref:`lsf` maintains a `directory of Lino
applications <http://www.lino-framework.org/about/overview.html>`_ that can be
used out of the box (by :term:`hosting providers <hosting provider>`) or by
:term:`development providers <development provider>` (as a base for their own
application).
