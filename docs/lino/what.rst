What is Lino?
=============

**Lino** is a :term:`framework`
for developing :term:`customized database
applications <customized database application>`
without getting locked into a proprietary vendor.
It is a sustainably free :term:`software product` governed and
maintained by the :ref:`lsf`.

Lino is **based on free software technologies** like `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__, `React <https://reactjs.org/>`__, `Sencha
ExtJS <https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`__, `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ and `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__.

Lino is suitable for writing **complex applications**.  For example Lino Welfare
has 155 database models in 65 plug-ins and 16 user types.

Lino is an **encompassing** framework because it provides *back-end
technologies* (server, application, database), *front-end technologies*
(JavaScript, ExtJS, React), a *documentation framework* and *marketing models*.

Lino **encourages sharing**: the :ref:`lsf` maintains a `directory of Lino
applications <http://www.lino-framework.org/about/overview.html>`_ that can be
used out of the box (by :term:`hosting providers <hosting provider>`) or by
:term:`development providers <development provider>` (as a base for their own
application).


**Q: Is Lino an accounting software?**

A: Accounting is just one functionality covered by Lino. And actually it isn't
even yet in production anywhere. We are testing it. People usually prefer to use
some "established" software for their accounting.

**Q: What's the main function of Lino?**

A: It's a framework to write applications. Comparable to SAP. Or imagine a very
generic ERP software.  Here are some functions that are currently being used on
Lino :term:`production sites <production site>`:

- Office functionality (contact management, group calendar, notes, tasks, ...)
- Recording contracts and agreements and print them out
- Record and maintain customized data about people and business partners
- Generate pdf or odt documents based on database content.
- Upload files and manage them
