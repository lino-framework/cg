About Lino
==========

The :term:`Lino framework`
allows developing :term:`customized database
applications <customized database application>`
without getting locked into a
proprietary vendor.
It is a sustainably free :term:`software product` governed and
maintained by the :ref:`lsf`.

The :term:`Lino framework` is **encompassing** because besides
**back-end** (server, application, database) and **front-end**
(JavaScript, ExtJS, React) technologies, it
also provides a **documentation framework**
and even **marketing models** (documented in our `Community Guide
<http://community.lino-framework.org/>`__).

Typical Lino applications have a rather **complex database
structure**.  For example Lino Welfare has 155 models in 65 plugins.
Even Lino Noi (the smallest Lino application which is being used on a
production site) has 44 models in 32 plugins.

A growing collection of maintained real-world applications can be
used by **service providers** who offer professional hosting of one of
these applications.
