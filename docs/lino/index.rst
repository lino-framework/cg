About Lino
==========

**Lino** is a :term:`framework`
for developing :term:`customized database
applications <customized database application>`
without getting locked into a proprietary vendor.
It is a sustainably free :term:`software product` governed and
maintained by the :ref:`lsf`.

Lino is based on free open-source technologies like `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__, `React
<https://reactjs.org/>`__, `Sencha ExtJS
<https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`__, `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ and `Python
<https://www.python.org/>`__. 

Lino is an **encompassing** framework because it includes
**back-end technologies** (server, application, database),
**front-end technologies** (JavaScript, ExtJS, React),
a **documentation framework** and **marketing models**.

Typical Lino applications have a rather **complex database
structure**.  For example Lino Welfare has 155 models in 65 plugins.
Even Lino Noi (the smallest Lino application which is being used on a
production site) has 44 models in 32 plugins.

A collection of maintained real-world applications can be used by **service
providers** who offer professional hosting of one of these applications.
