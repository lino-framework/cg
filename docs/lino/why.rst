Why Lino
========

Lino is for you, if...

- you have a concrete need for a customized database application
- you want a stable and sustainable solution
- you are ready to invest your own time for analysis and testing
- you want to keep control over your data even when your relationship
  with a given software provider breaks.

Lino *is not* for you, if...

- you just want a quick and dirty website with dynamic content
- you don't want to spend your time into developing a new software
- you want a cool website featuring the latest web technologies
- you don't plan to maintain your application


Lino's **design goals**:

- Lino applications are **easy to understand** for the end user
  (see :doc:`values`).
- Lino applications are **easy to develop** because Lino encourage
  agile programming, rapid prototyping and short release cycles.
- Lino applications are **easy to maintain** because Lino encourages
  sustainable application development.
- Lino applications are **stable as rock** once you decided that they
  satisfy your needs. No forced upgrades.
- Lino applications are **easy to share** because Lino encourages a
  deeply modular approach with libraries of highly reusable code.

- Lino applications **do not** try to be **sexy**. They are optimized for people
  who get a few hours of training before they start using it and who will use it
  for their everyday work. With Lino it takes a few hours before an end user
  starts loving it, but that love will --hopefully-- be deeper and last longer.
