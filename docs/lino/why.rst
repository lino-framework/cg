Why should I want Lino?
=======================

As a :term:`site operator` you might wonder why you should choose a
:term:`development provider` who uses the Lino framework.

Lino is for you, if...

- you have a concrete need for a customized database application
- you want a stable and sustainable solution
- you are ready to invest your own time for analysis and testing
- you want to keep control over your investment even when your relationship
  with a given :term:`development provider` breaks.

Lino *is not* for you, if...

- you just want quickly some nice web site with dynamic content
- you don't want to invest your time into developing a new software
- you want a cool website featuring the latest web technologies
- you don't worry about long-term maintenance of your application

Lino's **design goals**:

- Lino applications are **easy to understand** for the :term:`end user`
  (see :doc:`values`).
- Lino applications are **easy to develop** because Lino encourage
  agile programming, rapid prototyping and short release cycles.
- Lino applications are **easy to maintain** because Lino encourages
  sustainable application development.
- Lino applications are **stable as rock** once you decided that they
  satisfy your needs. No forced upgrades.
- Lino applications are **easy to share** because Lino encourages a
  deeply modular approach with libraries of highly reusable code.

- Lino applications **do not** try to be **sexy**. They are optimized for people
  who get a few hours of training before they start using it and who will use it
  for their everyday work. With Lino it takes a few hours before an end user
  starts loving it, but that love will --hopefully-- be deeper and last longer.
