The Lino vision
===============

There are so many application frameworks out there!  Does the Lino project
make sense? Good question.

The basic idea of the Lino project is developed below in a few steps:

- We believe that software must be free.  A free human civilization is
  incompatible with proprietary software.

- While the free world has an operating system and an office suite, there is no
  serious free solution for organizations who want to develop a :`customized
  database applications`.  The market of customized database applications is
  currently dominated by a few proprietary giants.

- The Lino framework has the potential of becoming a solution for this problem.

- This potential is currently merely visible.  There is much work to do to bring
  Lino to the next level so that it can grow from a project with a handful of
  developers into a reliable international infrastructure.
  Some important features are still missing or unfinished.


- Rumma & Ko wants to remain a family-sized dynamic team of creative developers.
  They don't have the human resources for bringing Lino to the next level.

- Even if Rumma & Ko *would* decide to become big and do this job, this wouldn't
  be a solution.  The role of bringing Lino to the next level must be played by
  an organization that does not have any private interest. A private corporation
  with limited responsibility is not a valid candidate for this job.

- That's why Lino needs a foundation or some similar non-profit legal person,
  inspired by the `PSF <https://www.python.org/psf/>`__ or the `DSF
  <https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/>`__.
