History
=======

The history of Lino starts in 1992 with TIM, a DOS-based framework used to
write customized database applications for small enterprises.
TIM was written by Luc Saffre for PAC Systems as copyright holder.

Although TIM is almost 30 years old, it continues to return enough money for
maintaining it and giving professional support to its users.  TIM users have
relatively wide-spread profiles, ranging from the independent craftsman who
writes 50 invoices per year to the government agency with 30 users and hundreds
of documents per day.

Luc has been working on writing a successor for TIM **since 1996**.  He has
done and dropped projects in C++, PHP and Java.

PAC Systems changed their name to AbAKUS in 2003(?).

Since **August 2004** Luc is mostly working in Python. In **March 2009** he
discovered *Django* whose database model and application server concepts seem
ideal for Lino. In **August 2009** he started to use the *ExtJS* Javascript
framework. In **August 2013** he published a first version of Lino on
`Sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/p/lino/news/>`_ .

The first real-world Lino application went into production in a Belgian *Public
Centre for Social Welfare* (PCSW) in **January 2011**.  In **August 2012** he
forked "Lino Welfare" out of the Lino core it into a separate :term:`source
repository` in order to make it maintainable by an independant organization.

In **September 2012** he registered the domain name `lino-framework.org`.

The second real-world Lino application started :doc:`in Czechia <joe>` in
**July 2013**.

In **March 2014** we started the third Lino production site, a second Lino
Welfare.

In **December 2015** Lino got a second developer to assist Luc: `Hamza Khchine
<https://github.com/khchine5>`__ started working for Lino as a freelancer.

The `Lino Voga <http://voga.lino-framework.org>`__ project started in **January 2016**, thanks to Alexa
who worked as a volunteer analyst almost full-time during eight
months.

From **April to November 2016**, Annalisa and Johannes gave much of
their time for the `Lino Care <http://care.lino-framework.org>`__ project.

From **January to May 2017**, Tanel worked for Lino as project manager
for `Lino Vilma <http://vilma.lino-framework.org>`__.

In **February 2017** `Tonis <https://github.com/CylonOven>`__ started
working for Lino as the second full-time developer.

In **December 2016** we started the `Lino Avanti <http://avanti.lino-framework.org>`__ project.

In **May 2017** we started to work on `Lino Tera <http://tera.lino-framework.org>`__.

In **June 2018** we started to work on `Lino Presto <http://presto.lino-framework.org>`__.

.. In **November 2018** Thierry started to help us with the sales work.

While Avanti and Welfare run well, the Tera and Presto projects had difficult to
start because of changes among the customers' personnel.

In **June 2020** we sent away Tonis and Hamza after three years of great
teamwork. We wanted them to share their know-how to other companies.  They
continue to help occasionally when needed. Read the details in Luc's blog post
`Lino reaches a new level
<https://luc.lino-framework.org/blog/2020/0628.html>`__.

In **September 2020** Aris from Greece started to work with my help on `Lino
Mentori <https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/mentori>`__.

In **October 2020** Hannes from Tartu started working full-time as our system
administrator.
